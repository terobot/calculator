# calculator

Small JavaScript, HTML and CSS practise. Calculator works either by clicking buttons or typing with keyboard. With keyboard it accepts only same keys as clickable buttons represent. You can also paste formula with CTRL+V, but it needs to contain only same chars as buttons represent.

Code is a bit of a mess and in one big chunk, but feel free to take a look if interested.

Some behavious, that may be a bit odd:
2(-2)²=8
2(-2²)=-8
