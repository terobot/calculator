# calculator

Small JavaScript, HTML and CSS practise. Calculator works either by clicking buttons or typing with keyboard. With keyboard only keys shown as buttons accepted. You can move on console with arrows left and right. You can double click results and formulas to add them on console. Delete and backspace keys work same way as with typical consoles. You can also paste formula with CTRL+V, but it needs to contain only same chars as buttons represent or formula will not be accepted. C key clears the console.

Code is a bit of a mess and in one big chunk, but feel free to take a look if interested.

Some behaviour, that may be a bit odd:
2(-2)²=8,
2(-2²)=-8
